            <p><strong>Youth Confirmation</strong></p>
            <p>TIMELINE  OF  CONFIRMATIONS  FOR YOUTH</p>
            <p>For detailed information and requirements please search under the "Children & Youth" tab, then "Sacramental Preparation".</p>
            <p>What are the Ages to Confirm my child?</p>
            <p>The sacrament of confirmation is to be conferred on the faithful at about the age of discretion, unless the Episcopal Conference has decided on a different age, or there is a danger of death or, in the judgement of the minister, a grave reason suggests otherwise.  The Age of Discretion is 7 years of age. (From Canon Law, 891).</p>
            <p>Note the following Complementary Norm which has been promulgated by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops: "The National Conference of Catholic Bishops, in accord with the prescriptions of canon 891, hereby decrees that the Sacrament of Confirmation in the Latin Rite shall be conferred between the age of discretion and about sixteen years of age, within the limits determined by the diocesan bishop and with regard for the legitimate exceptions given in Canon 891."</p>
            <p>As such, as your child progresses through their spiritual growth with the Catholic church, they should ideally be confirmed between the ages of 7 and 16 - as you have made the commitment to Baptism, then it stands to reason that their faith should be nurtured accordingly and thus they should be confirmed when the child reaches the Age of Discretion.</p>
            <p>Confirmation for Youth starts HERE.</p>
            <p>Please note that while the usual timeline to receive Confirmation should take place between 7 and 16 years of age, some people come to the Catholic faith later in life or go through the Rites at a later time due to life circumstances.  For adults age 18 and older and out of high school, please visit the Adult Education pages, under "Adult Confirmation," or "Becoming Catholic," then contact the Director of Adult Education.</p>

            <p>A special note for adults seeking to enter the Catholic Faith:  You have made a beautiful decision in your personal and spiritual journey. You will gain preparation and enrichment through a process known as RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults) and this will be of importance in preparing you to live out your commitment to the Catholic faith.  </p>

            <p><strong>Baptism for Adults</strong></p>
            <p>What is R.C.I.A.?</p>
            <p>R.C.I.A. (or simply "RCIA") stands for the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults, the process by which an adult person is initiated into the Catholic Church, through Baptism, Confirmation, and First Holy Communion.  Through this process the adult is formed in the Christian faith, with the local parish community serving as both catechists and models.</p>
            <p>Who is in the R.C.I.A.?</p>
            <p>*  Un-baptized adults</p>
            <p>*  Adults baptized in non-Trinitarian formula</p>
            <p>*  Adults baptized as Catholic, but lack First Holy Communion and Confirmation</p>
            <p>*  Adults baptized & confirmed infants in the Catholic Church, but lack First Holy Communion</p>
            <p>*  Adults baptized in other Christian Churches, in the Trinitarian formula w/water</p>
            <p>A History of RCIA</p>
            <p>R.C.I.A. has been around since the early Church - and was the method in which the Church prepared un-baptized adults to be received into the Christian Church (which later became known as the Catholic Church).  The R.C.I.A. process was an intense period of study, prayer, and conversion which (in the Church's early days) often lasted up to three years.  During the process, a sponsor would testify to the entire assembly of the conversion, authenticity, and genuine readiness of the individual.  After some time, the process was put aside and in its place private preparation was used.</p>
            <p>R.C.I.A. in the Modern Era</p>
            <p>The Second Vatican Council brought back the R.C.I.A. process in keeping with the spirit of communal participation of the whole Church.  Inquirers enter into a public process, are formed in community, and integrated into the life of the Church through that community. </p>
            <p>Keeping in the spirit of the original preparation, the base elements of study, prayer, community, and discernment remain and are integral, though persons may now possibly enter the Church in a shorter time-frame, based on his/her needs.  While there are standards or measures by which to discern a person's proper place in the R.C.I.A., and how long each will be in each phase, there is no absolute schedule for an RCIA process to run; it varies from parish to parish, and with person-to-person.</p>
            <p>The decision to accept baptism, or to become a Catholic, or to complete one's Catholic initiation must be the free will of each person.  The Catholic Church does not coerce, guilt, nor do we manipulate this decision.      </p>
            <p>Regardless of a person's age or circumstances, the Church is tasked with the duties, rights, and responsibilities to ensure that each individual meets the requirements set out by the Code of Canon Law, as well as publicly demonstrates the desire, readiness, and lifestyle that reflects acceptance and understanding of the Gospel and becoming a member of the Catholic Church. </p>
            <p>R.C.I.A. Phases</p>
            <p>The Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults is comprised of four phases.  These phases follow the experience of conversion to and initiation in the Christian faith.</p>
            <p>Inquiry (aka: Evangelization): This phase mimics the first experience of hearing the Word of God, of becoming aware of God's presence, love, and work in our lives.  In this first awareness, one is getting to know who God is through story-telling of their own life and the stories of the Bible.  It is the phase in which the first stirrings of faith in Jesus Christ begin.  For one that is already baptized, it is a re-awakening of that awareness and beginning of renewal, as well as first intentional integration into the community of believers.  The duration of time in this phase for the un-baptized and baptized, but un-catechized may be anywhere from 6 weeks to six months, depending on how one progresses.</p>
            <p>Ritual: Rite of Acceptance (un-baptized) and Rite of Welcome (baptized) for those that have indicated, and given evidence of conversion, and desire to follow the way of Christ through the Catholic Church.</p>
            <p>Catechumenate: This phase is the apprenticeship towards Christian discipleship.  It is accomplished through formal instruction in the core teachings and beliefs (doctrine) of the faith and experienced through liturgy, service, and parish community life.  This comprehensive approach aims for a thorough integration of the faith.  The Catechumenate follows the liturgical cycle of the Church since that is how the faith is experienced in daily life.  For the un-baptized, and the un-catechized, at least one full liturgical year is required, but this may last possibly longer, depending on when a person begins and how they progress.  For one who is baptized and well-catechized, this period is fit to one's individual needs, but still retains the necessary formation from both formal instruction and integration with the parish.  </p>
            <p>Ritual: Rite of Election for the un-baptized who have given clear evidence of acquaintance and integration of the core teachings and beliefs and desire to accept baptism.  Call to Continuing Conversion for the baptized who also demonstrate acquaintance and integration of the core teachings and beliefs and desire to complete their initiation, or come into full communion with the Catholic Church.</p>
            <p>Purity & Enlightenment: This phase, indicated by its name points to an intense, inward reflection and discernment.  In this phase, the candidate seeks to be purified in their intentions to follow Christ more fully, to recognize any sinful attachments or attitudes that still separate or diminish their relationship with Christ, and to receive the light they need to follow him more authentically.  It is no longer a time to "learn teachings that were not picked up" - those must be completed fully prior to beginning this phase.  Included in this phase are spiritual retreats, and smaller rituals intended to support and assist each person.  This phase occurs for the un-baptized and un-catechized (baptized) during Lent, following a 1-2 liturgical year preparation in the Catechumenate.  For the baptized that are well catechized, this phase is adapted to fit their needs, whenever that may be. </p>
            <p>Ritual: Sacraments of Initiation - Baptism, Confirmation, First Holy Communion for the un-baptized.  For the baptized, Profession of Faith for non-Catholics, plus Confirmation and First Holy Communion.  For the baptized only Catholic, Confirmation and First Holy Communion.</p>
            <p>Mystagogia: It is said that all of the baptized faithful are continuing this phase because we are still reflecting on the story of Christ, and still experiencing the conversion from our Christian initiation, regardless of when that occurred.  The Mystagogia, strictly speaking, occurs for the neophytes and newly professed members for the period between Easter and Pentecost.  Some experts propose a year-long mystagogia.  The mystagogia period is similar to the story of walk along the road Emmaus.  The disciples were so excited and filled with wonder telling the story of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection that they did not recognize it was Christ to whom they were speaking, until the breaking of the bread.  He helped them understand his story in relation to the Scriptures, and all they had experienced.  It is a time of reflection, celebration, and active participation in the life and mission of the Church.  For the newly-baptized, this may be a longer period than the six weeks after Easter. For the baptized, newly professed, this period is adapted to individual needs.</p>
            <p>Is R.C.I.A. a lecture series for anyone to attend?</p>
            <p>R.C.I.A. is a discernment and preparation process, not an adult education lecture series or catechism for Catholics seeking to refresh their own knowledge of the faith.  Because of the trust needed for participants to share openly, this process is only for those discerning to enter the Church.  To respect the inherent vulnerability and sensitive nature of the process, we refrain from inviting general visitors/parishioners to attend.  The only non-participants that are permitted are team members, clergy, and sponsors.   </p>
            <p>Adult Catholics seeking to learn more about the faith should inquire into Adult Education opportunities offered in the parish.  To learn more about these events, please return to the header "Adult Ed" and see programs listed (excluding RCIA & Adult Confirmation).</p>

            <h3>The Sacrament of <?php echo isset($_GET['pagename'])? ucwords($_GET['pagename']) :""; ?></h3>
            <p><strong>Adult Holy Communion </strong></p>
            <p>CCC: 1322-1419 </p>
            <p>The Eucharist, as stated in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, is "the source and summit of the Christian life." (1324)  All ecclesiastical ministries, all the Sacraments, and works of the apostolate, are bound up with the Eucharist and are oriented toward it. </p>
            <p>Because the Catholic Church was born of the paschal mystery, the Eucharist stands at the center of the life of The Holy Mother Church.   Acts 2:42 states “They devoted themselves to the Apostles’ teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers” as one very clear indication of the importance of the Eucharist.  Carrying on of this primordial image of the Catholic Church over the millenia is at every celebration of the Eucharist - for when we partake of the Sacrament of the Eucharist we are spiritually brought back to the paschal Triduum: literally to the events of the evening of Holy Thursday, to the Last Supper and all the glorious events that followed. </p>
            <p>Thus, with the Baptism and the Confirmation, the Eucharist completes the Sacraments of Christian Initiation, and the beauty is that this is celebrated with every Mass.  By the Eucharistic celebration we already unite ourselves with the heavenly liturgy and anticipate eternal life, when God will be all in all. </p>
            <p>What is the Eucharist?  It is the bread and wine that by the words of consecration have become the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ.  It is Christ himself, the eternal high priest of the New Covenant who, acting through the ministry of his priests, offers the Eucharistic sacrifice.  And it is the same Christ, really present under the form of bread and wine, who is the offering of the Eucharistic sacrifice.  Christ is both the priest and the sacrificial lamb, priest and victim. </p>
            <p>When the bread and wine are consecrated in the Eucharist, they cease to simply be bread and wine, and become (respectively), the body and blood of Christ.  This inner transformation is referred to as " transubstantiation."  Transubstantiation means that while the Body and Blood still retain the outward physical properties of bread and wine, at the words of consecration, their very substance is permanently changed so that they become in fact, the Body and Blood of Christ.  (CCC 1374-76) </p>
            <p>For this reason, the consecrated hosts that are not consumed at any given Mass are reserved in a special retaining vessel known as the "tabernacle."  Recall in the Old Testament that the Israelites kept the sacred tablets among them in a tent as a sign of God's presence among them.  The tabernacle is made a holy object by the content which it holds: Christ himself.  Reserved consecrated hosts are later distributed to the sick and elderly.  The Precious Blood because of the properties of wine that will spoil, must be consumed entirely at the Mass in which it was consecrated.  </p>
            <p>Consecration of the bread and wine represents the separation of Jesus' body from his blood at Calvary.  However, Christ has risen, and as such, the body and blood of Christ can no longer be truly separated.  Where one is, so the other must be. Therefore the person receiving either the Sacred Host or Precious Blood is receiving Christ, whole and entire.   </p>
            <p>The importance of this - the receipt of the entire Christ regardless if the body or blood is consumed - is important since individuals with aversions to gluten or fermented beverages can still receive the entire Eucharist by accepting either body or blood. </p>
            <p>Proper Reception of the Eucharist: </p>
            <p>Because we are receiving Christ himself at the Eucharist, Catholics must be in a " state of grace."  A state of grace means that we are free of any serious sin, and living according to the teachings of the Catholic Church.  For adults, this includes if we are married, we are married by the Church.  If we are single, we are living chastely.  (CCC 1384-1395, 1415) </p>
            <p>If one is conscious of grave sin, he or she must make amends to correct the situation and seek forgiveness through the Sacrament of Reconciliation (Confession) prior to reception of the Eucharist.  </p>
            <p>We are to fast for at least one hour prior to the reception of the Eucharist.  Fasting is from food or beverage, including gum, and candy.  Drinking water or taking necessary medication is permitted. </p>
            <p>Manner of Receiving Holy Communion in the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston </p>
            <p>Our unity is expressed in our Creed and communal worship, but it is also expressed in our gestures.  Each diocesan bishop retains the right to determine the gesture/posture for receiving Holy Communion in his diocese(arch).  If we are in another diocese, and their gestures or postures are different from our own, the proper sign of unity is to do as they do.  So it is in our own archdiocese; we use the same gestures and postures as a sign of our unity.  This may mean sacrificing our own personal preferences, but such sacrifice may be offered up for the good of the Church. </p>
            <p>In the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, the norm for receiving Holy Communion (Eucharist) is standing.  One makes a reverent small bow prior their turn, or in front of the minister, and when the minister says the words "The Body of Christ," or "The Blood of Christ," they reply "Amen" loud enough for the minister to hear.  It is the communicant's choice whether to receive on the hands or tongue, or whether to receive from both species of Body and Blood or just one. </p>
            <p>To receive on the hands: To receive the Body of Christ in one's hands, after bowing, and responding "Amen," the communicant holds out both hands with one hand cupping the other so as to form a well or throne upon which the minister will place the sacred host.  The communicant takes one step to the side and consumes (eats) the Sacred Host at once.  </p>
            <p>What not to do: </p>
            <p>= Hold out one hand; </p>
            <p>= Hold both hands out "side by side" </p>
            <p>= Take the Sacred Host from the minister (reaching out) </p>
            <p>= Walk off with the Sacred Host without immediately consuming </p>
            <p>To receive on the tongue: To receive the Body of Christ on the tongue, after bowing and responding "Amen," the communicant opens the mouth wide, and sticks out their tongue while holding the head slightly back.  This ensures the Body of Christ will not fall out of their mouth, and that the minister has enough room to place it on their tongue without incident.  Hands should be folded together down at the hip/waist. </p>
            <p>What not to do: </p>
            <p>= Barely open mouth so minister must fit Sacred Host between the teeth; </p>
            <p>= Dip head downwards  </p>
            <p>= Keep tongue inside </p>
            <p>= Hold hands up close to face </p>
            <p>Receiving the Precious Blood: To receive the Precious Blood, one bows again, and responds "Amen," to the words "The Blood of Christ."  The minister will hold out the cup (to adults) and the communicant takes the cup with BOTH HANDS, and consumes a swallow.  The communicant SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY hands the cup back to the minister with BOTH HANDS fitting hands so that they do not bump the minister's hands. </p>
            <p>For children: For children who have received First Holy Communion, the child will still bow, and respond "Amen," to the words "The Blood of Christ."  However, the minister may hold the cup to the child's mouth for them to drink if the child is small or the cup is unusually  heavy.</p>
            <p>What not to do: </p>
            <p>= Reach out for the cup before responding "Amen" </p>
            <p>= Reach out for the cup with one hand </p>
            <p>= Hand the cup back to the minister with one hand </p>
            <p>After receiving Holy Communion, one should return to the pew in a prayerful spirit, giving thanksgiving to Jesus for the gift of himself.  If a hymn is being sung, the faithful should join in singing the hymn.  If the hymn is over, one may either kneel or sit and remain quietly in prayer of praise and thanksgiving.  </p>
            <p><strong>Adult First Holy Communion</strong></p>
            <p>Adult Catholics that have not received their First Holy Communion are invited to prepare for this sacrament through the R.C.I.A., or Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults.</p>
            <p>R.C.I.A., while primarily instituted for the un-baptized, is also the process by which Catholics that lack First Holy Communion, or lack BOTH First Holy Communion and Confirmation are properly prepared for the sacrament(s). </p>
            <p>Because Catholics in this situation are uncatechized, the Church expects them to be prepared for the sacraments and the commitment of living out their faith along with the un-baptized.  The minimum time that this preparation might take place is one liturgical year, but no exact time is predicted up front; it is a process of formation and depends upon the spiritual and moral maturity of each individual. </p>
            <p>Catholics lacking only the Sacrament of Confirmation are prepared through the Adult Confirmation preparation.</p>
