                <p>Since established at 2009, MyFood Indonesia distributed the excellence, expertise, and quality products our customers need to develop and operate successful food operations and experiences. We’ve grown to become a nationwide spread distributor in Java - Indonesia by upholding the same business approach — being passionately committed to the people we serve. We believe in the power of good products — to bring business to people that we serve. Every product, every order and every decision we make is inspired by the people on the other side of the plate.  We care about you, we care about your customer.</p>
